# Fathom

Fathom is a speedy, sexy JS/CoffeeScript game development library. 

## Checkout

Only the `fathom.js` file is necessary for use.

For the development version, `git clone git://github.com/sarenji/fathom.git`.

If you want to try out the example game, `git clone --recursive git://github.com/sarenji/fathom.git`.

Just want the example game by itself? `git clone git://github.com/johnfn/depths.git`.

## Depths

Fathom comes with the example game Depths, which is intended to demonstrate how to use Fathom. If you checked out the development version without the --recursive option but now want the example game, type this command:

`git submodule update --init`

Then open `depths/index.html` in your favorite web browser. Bam! Game.

## Tests

Run all test suites via `cake test`.
